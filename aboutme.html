						Hey! I'm Doug!
					</h2>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					I'm currently a Software Development Manager at ARCOS LLC, working in New Paltz, NY.
					I work on several of the proprietary applications ARCOS offers, including Resource Assist,
					sMART, Mobile Inspections, and Damage Assessment. This work includes development and
					deployment of these applications to new and current customers.
				</p>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					My background includes a degree in Game Design and Development, a degree in Marine
					Transportation, military service, publishing my own table-top card game, and several producer jobs in the game industry. I thoroughly
					enjoy producer / software development manager positions because it gives me the flexibility
					to work with all parts of the software, and interact with as many people as possible on the team.
					Additionally, I feel the position gives me a chance to continue my own development as a leader,
					growing from those skills I learned while in the US Coast Guard.
				</p>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					In my spare time, I'm an avid gamer, hiker, bicyclist, and enjoy doing personal development projects.
					I have an ~8 (rescue!) year old black kitty named Cassie, who bugs me non-stop when I'm home. I love her to death.
				</p>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					My current spare-time projects include a stats analysis sheet for a game I've been playing a lot of, and
					a gesture spell-casting game for the Google Daydream View.
