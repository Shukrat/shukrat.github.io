			My name is Douglas Mansell. I am a transfer student in Rochester Institute of Technology's
			Interactive Games and Media department. My passion lies in project management, 
			however I've very much enjoyed being involved with web development, design, and 
			programming in general. 
			
			<br><br>Prior to my arrival at RIT, I spent 3 years on active duty in the United States Coast Guard.
			I am currently still in the USCG, but as a reserve Lieutenant. Throughout my time in the USCG,
			I learned a great deal about project, personnel, and resource management. I found
			the planning and execution of events or projects that involved coordination with multiple
			groups and schedules to be challenging, but incredibly rewarding.
			
			<br><br>At RIT, I've tried to take on roles that let me expand my skill set. My abilities
			as a leader have greatly helped groups I've worked with, and I have learned an 
			incredible amount while here, both from other students, and from the faculty.
			
			<br><br>Finding a position allowing me to draw on all of my experiences would be an amazing 
			opportunity, and I know I can bring a lot to any team that hires me.
