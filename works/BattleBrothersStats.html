					What is Battle Brothers Stats Analysis?
				</h2>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					Battle Brothers Stats Analysis is a spreadsheet I put together for a game I recently picked up.
					In the game, you play as the leader of a mercenary company, hiring men, taking contracts, and building up wealth.
					The men you hire all have different backgrounds, and I began to notice that certain backgrounds were significantly
					better than others. So, I started compiling a set of data to analyse if this was the case, and found out it was.
					Since then, I've requested community input of statistics, and gotten well over 1000 contributions, and the
					spreadsheet has been pinned to the top of the subreddit.
