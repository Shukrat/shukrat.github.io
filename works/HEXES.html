					What is HEXES?
				</h2>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					HEXES!! is a fast-paced party card game where you hex your friends
					with rules they must follow!  Your goal is to stay in the game
					while managing to follow the rules on all the hexes you happen to receive.
					If you break one of these rules, youâ€™re out!
					On paper, it might sound pretty simple, but in practice,
					it can be incredibly difficult.  The hex rules combine with each other to
					create some absolutely hilarious moments.  Fun to play with friends and family!

					My Role - Team Lead
				</h2>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					Of our team of 5, I was Team Lead. I worked closely with Norman Greenberg, the Lead Designer.
					Along with a few others, we put together the Indiegogo campaign, including reaching
					out to printers for quotes, study of other successful crowdfunding campaigns, and
					managing communications with Hasbro and other entities.
					</br></br>
					We managed the social media and weekly / milestone updates for the Indiegogo campaign.

					Our Story
				</h2>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					HEXES!! was submitted to Hasbro's Next Great Game competition on September 29, 2015
					and chosen as one of the top 5 games out of over 500 submissions. We heard back from
					Hasbro on October 10th, 2015, giving us just 20 days to put together an Indiegogo crowdfunding
					campaign.
					</br></br>
					After an insanely intense few weeks, we launched our campaign on November 1, 2015.
					In the first day we raised over $2000, surging ahead of the other 4 campaigns / games we
					were competing against. We achieved "fully funded" status on November 7th, just 6 days after
					starting. Such an incredible exciting moment, but only the start of everything we needed to do.
					</br></br>
					We established a stretch goal: to create 20 extra Hex cards that were "Not Safe for Work" or
					NSFW. We set the funding bar for $8000, to cover printing costs, and other artists costs.
					In the end, this goal wasn't met, though we can't say we're unhappy about it. It would have
					been a very large amount of work piled on top of all the classes the team was taking at the time.
					</br></br>
					So, December came around, and our campaign closed with $7166 raised by 173 people. We could
					barely contain ourselves. We had successfully coordinated, managed, and ran a crowd funding
					campaign, with only 20 days of prep work. Additionally, with an almost 80% failure rate on
					Indiegogo for campaigns, we had pulled off something incredible. Now we would wait for Hasbro's
					decision.
					</br></br>
					And wait.
					</br></br>
					It took Hasbro a lot of deliberation and discussion to choose which game was ultimately to become
					their Next Great Game winner. HEXES!! was not chosen in the end, but none of us were unhappy about
					it. This game, the competition, and the experience is everything we could have hoped for.
					</br></br>
					HEXES!! will be printed by AdMagic and released in Q1 2016.
