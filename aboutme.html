						Hey! I'm Doug!
					</h2>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					I'm a transfer student in Rochester Institute of Technology's
			Interactive Games and Media department. My passion lies in project management,
			however I've very much enjoyed being involved with web development, design, and
			programming in general.
				</p>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					Prior to my arrival at RIT, I spent 3 years on active duty in the United States Coast Guard.
			Throughout my time in the USCG,
			I learned a great deal about project, personnel, and resource management. I found
			the planning and execution of events or projects that involved coordination with multiple
			groups and schedules to be challenging, but incredibly rewarding.

				</p>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					In my last semester at RIT, I've found a great amount of success. In our final
					game design class, my team and I made HEXES!! a party card game that was chosen
					as top 5 out of 500 submissions to Hasbro's Gaming Lab competition. We've since
					run a successful indiegogo campaign for it, and are in the final judging for December!
				</p>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					I was also the Lead Producer on a webapp development project, Bloxeo. It is a
					group brain storming webapp, applicable to gamejams, hackathons, or even more
					professional environments like development studios.
