					What is HEXES?
				</h2>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					HEXES!! is a fast-paced party card game where you hex your friends 
					with rules they must follow!  Your goal is to stay in the game 
					while managing to follow the rules on all the hexes you happen to receive.  
					If you break one of these rules, youâ€™re out!  
					On paper, it might sound pretty simple, but in practice, 
					it can be incredibly difficult.  The hex rules combine with each other to 
					create some absolutely hilarious moments.  Fun to play with friends and family!
