					What is Fortnite?
				</h2>
				<p class="aboutMeP">
					Fortnite is the living action building game from the developer formerly known
					as Epic MegaGames. You and your friends will lead a group of Heroes to
					reclaim and rebuild a homeland that has been left empty by myterious
					darkness only know as "the Storm".
					</br></br>
					Band together online to build extravagent forts, find or build insane weapons
					and traps and protect your towns from the strange monsters that emerge during the
					Storm. In an action experience from the only company smart enough to attach
					chainsaws to guns, get out there to push back the Storm and save the world.
					And don't forget to loot all the things.
